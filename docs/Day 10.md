## What is Linear Regression ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡

[Referring](https://mlu-explain.github.io/linear-regression/)

**Linear Regression** is a simple and powerful model for predicting a numeric response from a set of one or more independent variables. This article will focus mostly on how the method is used in machine learning, so we won't cover common use cases like causal inference or experimental design. And although it may seem like linear regression is overlooked in modern machine learning's ever-increasing world of complex neural network architectures, the algorithm is still widely used across a large number of domains because it is effective, easy to interpret, and easy to extend. The key ideas in linear regression are recycled everywhere, so understanding the algorithm is a must-have for a strong foundation in machine learning.

### Let's Be More Specific

**Linear regression** is a supervised algorithm that learns to model a dependent variable, _**y**_, as a function of some independent variables (aka "features"), <b>x<sub>i</sub></b>â€‹, by finding a line (or surface) that best "fits" the data. In general, we assume _**y**_ to be some number and each <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> can be basically anything. For example: predicting the price of a house using the number of rooms in that house (_**y**_ : price, <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> â€‹: number of rooms) or predicting weight from height and age (_**y**_ : weight, <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> : height, <b>x<sub>2</sub></b> : age).

In general, the equation for linear regression is

_**y**_ = <b>Î²<sub>0</sub></b> â€‹+ <b>Î²<sub>1</sub></b> <b>â€‹x<sub>1</sub></b> â€‹ + <b>Î²<sub>2</sub></b><b>â€‹x<sub>2</sub></b> â€‹+ ... + <b>Î²<sub>p</sub></b><b>â€‹x<sub>p</sub></b>â€‹ + Ïµ
