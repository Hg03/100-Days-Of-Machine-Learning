# Introduction

Hi, my name is **Harish Gehlot** and I am **Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast**. We are seeing that **100 days of machine learning** is getting popular. But this is a serious challenge of discipline 📜 and getting too much knowledge 👨‍🔬. So here I've designed a 100 days structure in which what I am doing everyday is discussed. So if you are also interested 🎃, Let's start this journey together.


# Structure 🪖

- Day 1

    - `In Day 1, we'll learn about Basic concepts of Machine Learning.`
    - `What is Machine learning ?.`
    - `Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning .`
    - `Procedure to build machine learning model and further serving it as application.`

- Day 2

    - `Some basic Machine Learning Interview questions .`
