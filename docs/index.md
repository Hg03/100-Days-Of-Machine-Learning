# Introduction

Hi, my name is **Harish Gehlot** and I am **Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast**. We are seeing that **100 days of machine learning** is getting popular. But this is a serious challenge of discipline üìú and getting too much knowledge üë®‚Äçüî¨. So here I've designed a 100 days structure in which what I am doing everyday is discussed. So if you are also interested üéÉ, Let's start this journey together.
