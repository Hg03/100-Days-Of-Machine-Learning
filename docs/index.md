# Introduction

Hi, my name is **Harish Gehlot** and I am **Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast**. We are seeing that **100 days of machine learning** is getting popular. But this is a serious challenge of discipline 📜 and getting too much knowledge 👨‍🔬. So here I've designed a 100 days structure in which what I am doing everyday is discussed. So if you are also interested 🎃, Let's start this journey together.


# Structure 🪖

- Day 1

    - `In Day 1, we'll learn about Basic concepts of Machine Learning.`
    - `What is Machine learning ?.`
    - `Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning .`
    - `Procedure to build machine learning model and further serving it as application.`

- Day 2

    - `Some basic Machine Learning Interview questions .`
    - `Difference between **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** Machine learning algorithm ?`
    - `Difference between **Data Engineer**, **Data Scienctist**, **Data Analyst** and **Machine Learning Engineer** ?`
    - `What is **Online** and **Offline** learning ?`
    - `How **Machine Learning** is different from **Deep Learning** ?`

- Day 3
    - `Machine Learning Lifecycle and their different aspects .`

- Day 4
    - `Analyze the Data and extract some insights i.e. **Exploratory Data Analysis** .`
    - `Use some dataset to visualize and extract information using python library .`

- Day 5
    - `Learn different methods to impute missing values (Numerical and categorical features).`

- Day 6
    - `Learn different methods to encode the categorical features .`

- Day 7
    - `Learn different methods to remove outliers.`

- Day 8
    - `Learn different methods for feature selection.`

- Day 9
    - `Generate a sequential pipeline to transform the dataset .`

- Day 10 to 15 (Building Small project)
    - `Learn and Implement **Linear Regression Algorithm** .`

- Day 16 to 20 (Building Small project)
    - `Logistic Regression`
