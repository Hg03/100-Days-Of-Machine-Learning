## Concepts and Terminologies

**What is Machine Learning and why Is It everywhere ?**

As the word says **Machine** and it's **Learning** means we have a machine or we can say function which takes some input values and predicts or calculates the answer. Easy 🍬🍬 ??

Let's take an example of our brain 🔽

Suppose you are **student** studying in senior secondary school, and you have a exam in somedays and you need to score good marks 💯 . For these, what you'll do, grab some books and study. By studying, internally your brain is learning pattern that which type of question can occurs, how to solve them. Here comes one term that is **training**. You are **training** 🚆🚆 your brain 🧠 to predict or calculate the answers for your upcoming exams. More your brain learns, more it will become **accurate** to the results. So we discussed is the layman's term for define **Machine learning** .

To be more **technical**, A machine 📠 is a system or module which takes **data** 🗃️ in form of **csv, excel file**, **some documents like docx or pdf**, some **images** or anything. Then we'll clear / filter or **preprocess** 💇 the data, Then our machine learns crucial patterns 📈 regarding that data like it builds some equations assigning some weights to some parameters. After learning or we can say **Model training** and after training, it predicts the results for unknown data by applying same pattern that it has learnt before.

Now let's get some familiarity with **Machine Learning** terminologies -
