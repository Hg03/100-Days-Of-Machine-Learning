## Concepts and Terminologies

**What is Machine Learning and why Is It everywhere ?**

As the word says **Machine** and it's **Learning** means we have a machine or we can say function which takes some input values and predicts or calculates the answer. Easy 🍬🍬 ??

Let's take an example of our brain 🔽

Suppose you are **student** studying in senior secondary school, and you have a exam in somedays and you need to score good marks 💯 . For these, what you'll do, grab some books and study. By studying, internally your brain is learning pattern that which type of question can occurs, how to solve them. Here comes one term that is **training**. You are **training** 🚆🚆 your brain 🧠 to predict or calculate the answers for your upcoming exams. More your brain learns, more it will become **accurate** to the results. So we discussed is the layman's term for define **Machine learning** .

To be more **technical**, A machine 📠 is a system or module which takes **data** 🗃️ in form of **csv, excel file**, **some documents like docx or pdf**, some **images** or anything. Then we'll clear / filter or **preprocess** 💇 the data, Then our machine learns crucial patterns 📈 regarding that data like it builds some equations assigning some weights to some parameters. After learning or we can say **Model training** and after training, it predicts the results for unknown data by applying same pattern that it has learnt before.

Now let's get some familiarity with **Machine Learning** terminologies - 

- `Data` : The raw information or observations used for training and testing machine learning models. Data can be in various forms, such as text, images, numbers, or more.

- `Feature` : An individual input variable or attribute used in a machine learning model to make predictions or classifications. Features are derived from the data.

- `Label or Target` : The output or outcome that a machine learning model predicts or classifies. In supervised learning, the model is trained to predict the label.

- `Training Data` : A subset of the data used to train a machine learning model. It includes both the features and their corresponding labels.

- `Testing Data` : A separate subset of the data used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after it has been trained.

- `Algorithm` : A set of rules and procedures that a machine learning model follows to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Examples include decision trees, neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors.

- `Model` : The result of training a machine learning algorithm on data. It represents the learned patterns and relationships in the data.

- `Supervised Learning` : A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, and its goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels.

- `Unsupervised Learning` : A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, and its goal is to discover patterns or structure in the data without specific output labels.

- `Classification` : A type of supervised learning task where the goal is to assign data points to predefined categories or classes.

- `Regression` : A type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value as the output.

- `Overfitting` : Occurs when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data because it has learned noise or irrelevant patterns.

- `Underfitting` : Occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data and performs poorly on both training and testing data.

- `Accuracy` : A common evaluation metric that measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances in a classification task.

- `Loss Function` : A mathematical function that quantifies the error between the model's predictions and the actual target values, used during training to optimize the model.

- `Feature Engineering` : The process of selecting, transforming, or creating new features from the raw data to improve a machine learning model's performance.

- `Validation Set` : A subset of the data used during model training to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
